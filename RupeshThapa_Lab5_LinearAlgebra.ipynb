        "Linear transformations are functions that send, or map, one vector to another vector. The simplest example of a linear transformation sends each vector to c times itself, where c is some constant. Thus, every vector remains in the same direction, but all lengths are multiplied by c. Another example is a rotation, which leaves all lengths the same but alters the directions of the vectors. Linear refers to the fact that the transformation preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. This means that if T is a linear transformation sending a vector v to T(v), then for any vectors v and w, and any scalar c, the transformation must satisfy the properties T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w) and T(cv) = cT(v).\n",

Further, by restricting each entry of the array to be the same data type, the array is stored in memory using a contiguous block of memory as it would be for arrays in the C programming language. Note that C-style arrays are good for more than just quickly performing operations through Python; they're also good for talking to existing C and Fortran code. This interoperability explains why NumPy matters to you even if you won't do any matrix computations by hand: many of the libraries that you _will_ want to use will use NumPy arrays under the hood."
